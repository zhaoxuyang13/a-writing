\section{Algorithms}

During base learning, an inner (or lower/base) learning algorithm solves a task such as image classification [13], defined by a dataset and objective. During meta-learning, an outer (or upper/meta) algorithm updates the inner learning algorithm such that the model it learns improves an outer objective

this is section 3, describe MAML (+ REPTILE maybe) ?
